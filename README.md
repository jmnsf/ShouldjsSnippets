# ShouldJS Sublime Text 2 & 3 Snippets

This is a package for Sublime Text 2 & 3 that provides autocompletion for the [ShouldJS](https://shouldjs.github.io/) assertion library. It supports only calls in the format `should(target).assertion(expectation)`. It *does not* include snippets like `target.should.assertion(expectation)`. This is by design.

## Installation

#### 1. Through git

1. Go to your packages folder (in Sublime : Preferences > Browse Packages…).
2. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/jmnsf/ShouldjsSnippets.git`

#### 2. Manually

Download this repo as a ShouldjsSnippets folder and save it into your packages (in Sublime : Preferences > Browse Packages…).

## Contributing

Feel free to open up an issue/PR if you find anything missing or an error in the current snippets.
